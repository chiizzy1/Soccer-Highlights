How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
i used html, css and vanilla JavaScript to build this project.
The Scorebat API (https://www.scorebat.com/video-api/) returned a array random of data and i had to sort through the array and collected the
datas for different football leagues togetherand i made the collected datas of each leagues into carousels to make it easier for users of the 
website to sort through football highlights of their preferred football leagues.

Lessons Learned:
I learnt about different ways to sort through the data an API returns and to populate a div(container) with this informations.
